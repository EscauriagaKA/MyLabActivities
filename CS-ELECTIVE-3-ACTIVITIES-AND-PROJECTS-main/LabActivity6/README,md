# Laboratory Activity 6: Bidirectional Control Using Arduino and Python

## Description
This project implements a **Bidirectional (Two-Way) Communication** system. It demonstrates a closed-loop interaction where a physical input (button press) triggers a software event in Python, which then sends a control signal back to the Arduino to update the hardware state (LED toggle).

## Circuit Design
The system utilizes the following components:
* **Inputs:** 3 Push buttons connected to pins 12, 11, and 10 using `INPUT_PULLUP`.
* **Outputs:** Red, Green, and Blue LEDs connected to pins 7, 6, and 5.
* **Control:** An Arduino Uno acting as the bridge between the physical components and the Python CLI.

## Code Logic
The system follows a specific communication handshake:
1. **Arduino to Python:** When a button is pressed, the Arduino sends a single character ('R', 'G', or 'B') to the Serial port.
2. **Python Processing:** The Python script (`lab_act6.py`) listens for these characters. Upon receiving one, it prints a confirmation message and sends a numeric command ('1', '2', or '3') back to the Arduino.
3. **Python to Arduino:** The Arduino receives the numeric command and toggles the corresponding LED state.
4. **Reliability Features:** - **Debouncing:** A `DEBOUNCE_DELAY` of 150ms is used in the header file to prevent multiple triggers from a single button press.
   - **Menu Handler:** A timer resets the console menu after 5 seconds of inactivity.
